## [School]World Happiness

### Summary
* Task: Propose visualisations for analysis of the World Happiness Report dataset and potentials methods of evaluation
  1. Has there been an overall increase in happiness score in the different countries from 2015-2017?
  2. How have the happiness ranks of the top 10 countries changed from 2015-2017?
  3. Which factor most affects the happiness score of a country?
* Data: historical price and VIX of "Coca-Cola" from 01/Jan/2010 ~ 10/Feb/2023 retrieved from yahoo finance
* Tools: Tableau

### Visualisation

### Key Points
1. According to scattered plots, all features have a positive correlation, especially the “Economy” has a strongest relationship.
2. The feature least correlated with the “Happiness Score” is “Generosity” with P-value between 0.0210 and 0.0524.
3. Trust factor is the most varied factors in regions affecting happiness score.
4. Bump chart for reasons of variations in rank of the top/bottom 10 countries, visible changes found. 
5. Generated dynamic visualizations to show the distribution of countries from high happiness rank to low rank
