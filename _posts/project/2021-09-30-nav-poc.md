## [Professional] NAV POC

### Summary
* Goal: Demonstrate and verify the data-driven evolution of NAV validation
* Data: Client product funds data bewteen 

### Key Milestone
1. Product Ideation 
* idea creation - brainstorming innovative product features
* hypothesis development - creating a set of hypothesis statements for innovative product features
* hypothesis validation - attaching a commercial statement to each hypothesis statement
* hypothesis prioritisation - prioritising each hypothesis for experiments by commercial (immediacy and value), research, and execution objectives
2. Computational environment
* data analysis workflow - building development environment
*	data governance – identify data, describe common procedures on data, summarise common terms
3.	Business development – access approval of client product data 
4.	Product requirements 
*	applied research performance – reviewing ML literature for each experiment requirement
*	experiment requirements – describing experiments for each hypothesis by identifying phenomena, observations, data, and approaches and forming user stories with acceptance criteria and concrete examples
*	data analysis – analysing the quality of production data for each experiment requirement
5.	Product feasibility – results based on hypothesis validation, experiment requirements, applied research performance, and data analysis

### Results
Incomplete product feasibility
This project has 5 milestones with 15 deliverables over 7 months. 9 deliverables are completed, and 6 deliverables are not completed.
