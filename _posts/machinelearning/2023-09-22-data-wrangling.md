## [ML] Data Wrangling

### background

The process of gathering, collecting, and transforming Raw data into another format for better understanding, accessing, and analysis.

### description

- Data profiling: shape of dataset, get the description of numeric variables
- Data visualisation: to better understand relationship between variables and to identify outliers
- Standardisation or normalisation: different scale of different variables donâ€™t negatively impact the performance of your model
- Handling null value: deleting rows, replacing null values with the mean or new category, predicting the value, or using machine learning models that can deal with those
- Others: removing irrelevant data, removing duplicates, and type conversions
