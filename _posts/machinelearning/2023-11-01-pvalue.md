## [ML] p-value

If the p-value is less than 0.05 (commonly used significance level), we reject the null hypothesis. 
This means there is strong evidence of a significant difference between the groups. 
The chance of it being a coincidence is less than 5%.

If the p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting no strong evidence of a significant difference.

~~~python
import scipy.stats as stats

# Simulated data for two groups (e.g., treatment and control)
group_a = [75, 80, 85, 90, 95]  # Sample data for group A
group_b = [60, 65, 70, 75, 80]  # Sample data for group B

# Perform a t-test to compare the means of the two groups
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group_a, group_b)

# Print the p-value
print(f"P-value: {p_value}")

# Interpret the p-value
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("The p-value is less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis.")
    print("There is strong evidence that there is a significant difference between the groups.")
else:
    print("The p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.")
    print("There is no strong evidence of a significant difference between the groups.")
