## [ML] Sampling

### background

Data sampling is a statistical analysis technique used to select, manipulate and analyse a representative subset of data points to identify patterns and trends in the larger data set being examined. 

### description

- Probability based sampling
    - Simple random: randomly sample subjects from the whole population
    - Systematic: sample is created by setting an interval, i.e. every 100th row
    - Stratified: a sample that is drawn from a number of separate strata of the population, rather than at random from the whole population, in order that it should be representative.
    - Cluster: the larger data set is divided into clusters based on a defined factor then a random sampling of clusters is analysed. The sampling unit is the whole cluster, instead of sampling individuals from within each group. A researcher will study whole clusters.
- Non Probability based sampling
    - Convenience: data is collected from an easily accessible and available group
    - Consecutive: data is collected from every subject that meets the criteria until the predetermined sample size is met
    - Purposive or judgmental: researcher selects the data to sample based on predefined criteria
    - Quota: researcher ensures equal representation within the sample for all subgroups in the data set or population (random sampling is not used)
