## [Algorithm] ANOVA

### description

- ANOVA (Analysis of variance) is a statistical method that to compare more than two groups to identify relationships between them.
- One-way ANOVA is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups. (using F distribution)
- 2 groups → t-test, 3 groups → one way ANOVA
- ANOVA tests assume that the data is normally distributed and that the levels of variance in each group is roughly equal.
- And it assumes that all observations are made independently. If these assumptions are not accurate, ANOVA may not be useful for comparing groups.
