## [Algorithm] Java DSA

### Big O
* is a way to comparing codes mathmatically about how efficient they run.
* time complexity -> measures in the number of operations that it takes to complete something
* space complexity -> measures memory space used
* Omega(best case), Theta(average case), Al Macron(worst case)
* O(n) -> O of n, i.e. for loop from 0 to n, proportional
* O(n^2) -> O of n squared, i.e. loop within a loop
* O(1) -> O of one, i.e. a simple one operation like '+', constant time, most efficient!
* O(log n) -> O of log n, i.e. out of 8 items in array, find one item using divide and conquer, 3 steps, log8 = 3 (log sub two of eight equals three)
* Big O of Array Lists -> i.e. add or remove something at the end, list.add(100) or list.remove(4) it will be O(1), but when we need to re index, list.add(0,100) or list.remove(0) it will be O(n)

### Linked List vs Array List
* linked list is dynamic in length, while array list is fixed in length
* linked list, instead of all of items being in a contiguous place in memory(that's why we have index), items are going to be spread out
* linked list has head for first node, tail for last node and others point next node
* Big O 

| Action       | Linked List | Array List  |
| -----------  | ----------- | ----------- |
| Append       | O(1)        | O(1)        |
| Remove Last  | O(n)*       | O(1)*       |
| Prepend      | O(1)        | O(n)        |
| Remove First | O(1)*       | O(n)*       |
| Insert       | O(n)        | O(n)        |
| Remove       | O(n)        | O(n)        |
| Lookup by Index | O(n)        | O(1)        |
| Lookup by Value | O(n)        | O(n)        |

### Two Sum
~~~java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
       
       // are there multiple solutions?
       // can I use same element twice?
       // what should I return when there is no right two numbers?
       Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
       for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
           int diff = target - nums[i];
           if(map.containsKey(diff)) {
               return new int[]{i, map.get(diff)};
           }
           map.put(nums[i], i);
       }
        return new int[]{-1, -1};
    }
}
