## [ML] Framing a ML Solution

## What would you like your model to do?
- Recommend useful products to shoppers

## What is the best possible outcome?
- Shoppers view recommended products
- Shoppers buy recommended products

## Quantify success and failure metrics
- 10% of the shoppers should click on recommended products
- 2% of the shoppers should buy recommended producst
- Success and failure metrics independent of evaluation metrics

## Ensure metrics are measurable
- How will you measure your metrics?
- When will metrics be available?
- Are measurements comparable?
- Allow for failing fast

## Choose the right ML solution based on required output
- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering
- Association rule learning
- Recommendation systems

## Define data used to train model
- Identify data sources
- Explore and understand data
- Pre-process your data to fit the model

## Start simple
- Express your problem as simply as possible
- Use the simplest model possible
- Establish a baseline with the simple model
- Use baseline eto make further decisions

## Is your model learning from data?
- Do you have enough data?
- Is your data skewed?
- Is your model generalising to unseen data?

## Refine and iterate
- Evaluate model against objective
- Tue model parameters
- Experiment with different odels
- Think about potential bias
