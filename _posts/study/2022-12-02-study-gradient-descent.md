       This project is to recommend credit cards on ads banner by personalisation. For this, I made several clusters based on useRs' app usage. After that, I could define the characteristics of standardisation by each group.
Data : 200,000 lines with 200 variables
Tools : Python
ML Algorithms : LightGBM
Evaluation metrics : AUC

Why Standardisation?
What Did I Find?
