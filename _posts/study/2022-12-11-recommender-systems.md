## [System] Recommender Systems

### Recommender Systems
Content-based 
- focus on the attributes of the items and give you recommendations based on the similarity between them.

Collaborative Filtering(CF) 
- produces recommendations based on the knowledge of users' attitude to items, that is it uses the 'wisdom of the crowd' to recommend items
- i.e. Amazon will suggest items based on other people's shopping experiences
- more commonly used because it usually gives better results and relatively easy to understand
- the algorithm has the ability to do feature learning on its own, it can start to learn for itself what features to use
- can be divided by Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering / Model-Based Collaborative Filtering
