## [Algorithm] Sort

#### Selection Sort
sorts an array by repeatedly finding the mininum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
time complexity is O(N^2)

~~~python
def selectionSort(array, size):

    for i in range(size):
        min_index = i

        for j in range(i + 1, size):
            if array[j] < array[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        # swapping
        (array[i], array[min_index]) = (array[min_index], array[i])

arr = [-2, 45, 0, 11, -9,88,-97,-202,747]
size = len(arr)
selectionSort(arr, size)
print(arr)
~~~

#### Bubble Sort
sorts an array by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
time complexity is O(N^2), lowest efficient algorithm

~~~python
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    swapped = False

    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] :
                swapped = True
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
        if not swapped:
            return                


arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubbleSort(arr)
print(arr)
~~~

#### Insertion Sort
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
time complexity is O(N^2), for almost sorted array, this is best

~~~python
def insertionSort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]

        j = i-1
        while j>=0 and key < arr[j]:
            arr[j+1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j+1] = key        


arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
insertionSort(arr)
print(arr)
~~~

#### Quick Sort
is a divide and conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. (usually first element)
time complexity is O(NlogN)

~~~python
def partition(array, low, high):
    pivot = array[high]
    i = low - 1

    for j in range(low, high):
        if array[j] <= pivot:
            i = i + 1
            (array[i], array[j]) = (array[j], array[i])
    (array[i+1], array[high]) = (array[high], array[i+1])
    return i+1

def quickSort(array, low, high):
    if low < high:
        pi = partition(array, low, high)
        quickSort(array, low, pi - 1)
        quickSort(array, pi + 1, high)


data = [1, 7, 4, 1, 10, 9, -2]
print(data)

size = len(data) 
quickSort(data, 0, size - 1)
print(data)
