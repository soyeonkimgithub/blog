## [Algorithm] Support Vector Machines

### Support Vector Machines
* supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyse data and recognise patterns, used for classification and regression analysis
* SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible
* New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on
* choose a hyperplane that maximises the margin between classes
* the vector points that the margin lines touch are kwon as Support Vectors
* when we cannot seperate classes with line, make it separable in the third dimension through another hyperplane

### Grid Search
* allows you to find the right parameters such as C or gamma
* all the best possible combination

~~~python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

svc = SVC()
svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
pred = svc.predict(X_test)

print(confusion_matrix(y_test, pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, pred))

param_grid = {'C':[0.1, 1, 10, 100], 'gamma':[1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001], 'kernel':['rbf']}
grid = GridSearchCV(SVC(), param_grid, verbose=2)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
grid_pred = grid.predict(X_test)

print(confusion_matrix(y_test, pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, pred))
